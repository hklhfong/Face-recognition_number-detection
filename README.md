The assignment involves a multifaceted approach, encompassing data cleaning, validation, graph plotting utilizing QQ plots, and the construction of a confusion matrix. The overarching goal is to achieve face recognition and number detection on a testing dataset.

Within the project, various machine learning techniques are employed for experimentation, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classification (SVC), and the utilization of pre-trained models with fine-tuning.
